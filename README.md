🏦 Ledger ServiceA stateless, production-ready Ledger microservice designed to demonstrate the integration of a Custom Spring Boot Security Starter and a Modular Intelligence Orchestration hub. This application focuses on financial transaction integrity while delegating AuthN/AuthZ logic and AI analysis to decoupled modules.🏗️ Architecture DesignThis service follows the Shared Security Kernel and Mediator patterns:Security Layer: Utilizes core-security-starter to automatically inject JwtAuthenticationFilter and enforce RBAC via centralized Auto-Configuration.Intelligence Layer (Task 2): Implements a decoupled Event-Driven Dispatcher. The Ledger module broadcasts activities via an internal bus, allowing the CoreIntelligenceService to orchestrate "AI Insights" without hard dependencies.🧠 Modular Intelligence Orchestration (Task 2)To satisfy the requirements for a "Core Intelligence Service," the system uses an internal event bus to handle inter-module communication:Decoupled Registration: The CoreIntelligenceService is a self-registering @Service that listens for system-wide events.Event-Driven Dispatch: The LedgerEventService acts as the producer, ensuring the Ledger remains "clean" of intelligence logic.Simulated AI: Real-time analysis of transaction amounts and types to detect high-value movements or account anomalies.Proof of Orchestration (Console Logs):Plaintext[INFO] Ledger Module: Emitting event for transaction TXN-777
[INFO] Intelligence Orchestrator: Received event for transaction ID: TXN-777
[INFO] AI INSIGHT GENERATED: High-value DEPOSIT detected. Recommendation: Enhanced liquidity check.

Upon startup, the logs verify that the security starter and the intelligence modules are active:Plaintexto.s.s.web.DefaultSecurityFilterChain : Will secure any request with [JwtAuthenticationFilter...]

🛠️ Getting Started1. Build the Core StarterThe security library must be installed in your local .m2 repository first:Bashcd ../core-security-starter
mvn clean install
2. Run the Ledger ServiceBashcd ../ledger-app
mvn spring-boot:run
